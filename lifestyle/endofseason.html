      <p class="w3-large">Day 8:
<br><br>

Scarlett boarded flight, got seated and texted Edward that she was going to take off and further included about how special he had made that one week. She was thankful to him.
<br><br>

Edward had already started missing her and to spend his time till Scarlett reaches Bradford he went to his office and started delineating her. He made such a beautiful portrait of Scarlett that everyone in his office started appreciating him and the beauty of Scarlett. After an hour passed, he was still busy in portraying his love, a friend of Edward came and told him about, the plane which was going to Bradford, had crashed. And only 4 people survived as many were dead and some got deeply sored. Listening to this, suddenly all colors from that painting and Edward’s life got vanished. He was in a state of trauma. His tears weren’t in control of him. He and his friend immediately checked for flight’s ticket but there was none. Then they searched for bus and got two tickets and left North Hampton. He constantly feared of loosing her.
<br><br>

After 5-6 hours they reached Bradford and went to airport to know about the people who were dead, alive or injured. There was a big chaos over there. Many were crying for the people they have lost.
<br><br>

He went here and there but got no information about Scarlett. He was tensed but at the same time praying for her life. He asked at almost every counter but nothing was achieved. He started thinking about what if Scarlett was dead? That was the worst fear of his life. Tears fell from his eyes and suddenly he asked a lady, having names of people who were in flight, and the hope of light came when he heard that she was admitted in city hospital having serious injuries. He just rushed to the city hospital and confirmed about her. She was in room number 205. Seeing her Edward couldn’t stop himself and started yelling and crying at the top of his voice.
<br><br>

Day 9:
<br><br>

24 hours passed and still there was no sign of recovery. Edward was still there. Even doctors weren’t showing any hope. Edward was sitting in cafeteria watching everyone crying over their losses and rushing here and there.
<br><br>

Till then he saw two more people asking about Scarlett. Later he discovered that they were Scarlett’s parents. He talked to them and told everything about him and Scarlett. They all were praying for her. Edward just kept sitting there and told his friend to go back. She had severe injuries. Doctors took her to ICU to do some surgery.
<br><br>

Pain which are physical and can be seen, are also felt by others but the pain which is inside the body or the heart can neither be seen nor be felt. The exact situation was with Edward, he was suffering from internal pain plus the pain of losing Scarlett. This emotional bond was connecting them.
<br><br>

Day 10:
<br><br>

The very next day she opened her eyes. But she could only hear everyone and wasn’t able to talk. When her parents met her after that Edward came in her room and both Scarlett and Edward just held hands and cried their heart out. May be that was the best therapy of the time. Then Edward thought it was time to make her happy, so he started making her smile, talking about how destiny made them meet, about their future and asked her that she has to live because he needed her the most in his life.
<br><br>

Scarlett has so much to say but she was on ventilation and was restricted by that. Doctors came and took her for further medical treatment.
<br><br>

Meanwhile Edward took leave from office and has not even gone out to see the sky. He just remain sitting near her, constantly, holding her hands tight. And inside praying hard to God for her life.
<br><br>

Whenever he visited cafeteria to bring some food for her parents, he met a small boy aged 5 years, who always asked him to not worry as Scarlett would be okay! This made him smile. But that day he said something which was very cute and surprising too.
<br><br>

That kid told Edward that he liked Scarlett so much that he wanted to marry her. Edward purchased a rose and gave it to that kid and took him to Scarlett’s room. After 5-6 hours, she opened her eyes surprisingly as she saw both of them standing beside her. Edward explained everything to her and kid bent on his knees and said ” will you please marry me?” Scarlett only cried and cried and wrote on a piece of paper that she would definitely do that but she was already married. After the kid left, Edward was holding her hand and said that he would never share her with anyone. Neither with small kid nor with God. While he was speaking to her, slowly Edward realized that grip between their hands was not tight. Their hands were loosening. And that was the time when Scarlett closed her eyes for forever. Doctors came and declared her dead. Edward wasn’t shocked but he was heartbroken. For him she was the first person with whom he shared so much and she was no more. After her funeral Edward never came back to Bradford ever again.
